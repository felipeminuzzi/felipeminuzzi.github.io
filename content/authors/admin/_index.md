Currently, I am an Assistant Professor at the [Institute of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.ufrgs.br/ime/) at [UFRGS](https://www.ufrgs.br/), Brazil. Previously, I worked in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.ufsm.br/unidades-universitarias/ccne/departamentos/depto-de-matematica) at [UFSM](https://www.ufsm.br/). My research interests encompass fluid dynamics, numerical methods for partial differential equations, and the application of machine learning in these areas. I am highly motivated to develop new deep learning methodologies, primarily through artificial neural networks, for forecasting and understanding ocean phenomena.

From 2020 to 2022, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UFRGS, working with [Prof. Leandro Farina](http://www.mat.ufrgs.br/~farina/english/) on the project titled "Ocean Wave Ensemble Forecast Using Deep Learning," funded by the [Office of Naval Research (ONR)](https://www.onr.navy.mil/). From 2018 to 2019, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [INPE](https://www.gov.br/inpe/pt-br), under the supervision of [Prof. Fernando Fachini](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fernando-Fachini), working on the project titled "Numerical study of soot formation in Tsuji burner using REDIM."

I completed my PhD in Applied Mathematics at [UFRGS](https://www.ufrgs.br/), under the supervision of [Prof. Alvaro de Bortoli](http://www.mat.ufrgs.br/~dbortoli/) and [Prof. Ulrich Maas](https://www.itt.kit.edu/21_88.php) from [KIT](https://www.kit.edu/), where I developed a new framework to reduce the complexity of numerically simulating reactive flows. A version of my thesis can be found [here](https://www.bibliotecadigital.ufrgs.br/da.php?nrb=001075720&loc=2018&l=a9e8703e0a330c2d).
