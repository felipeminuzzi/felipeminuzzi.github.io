abstract: Simulation of turbulent flames using detailed chemical mechanisms is still a challenge in numerical combustion due to the large number of species and the stiffness of the system of governing equations. In this sense, strategies to reduce the size of the detailed model are necessary and one of such models is the well-known directed relation graph (DRG) method. In the present work, a DRG-derived skeletal mechanism developed using only one application for methane/air simulations is presented and validated for auto-ignition times, laminar flame speed and counterflow flames. The skeletal mechanism is tested for varying the equivalence ratio (Ï•= 0.4, to 3) and pressure (p= 1 to 150 atm). The temperature spans the range from T= 1000 K to T= 2000 K. The relative error, compared with the detailed mechanism, of our proposed model for ignition delay times and flame speed are less than 10% for most of the parameters. The skeletal mechanism is also used to simulate the piloted turbulent jet Sandia Flame D. Results show that this skeletal mechanism can reproduce the main features of laminar and turbulent methane/air flames.
