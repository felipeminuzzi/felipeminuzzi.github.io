abstract: The present work focuses on the five different chemical mechanisms coupled with probability density function (PDF) model to represent the local extinction and re-ignition flame characteristics of the well-known Sandia Flames D–F. These five mechanisms span from the Foundational Fuel Chemistry Model (FFCM) mechanism involving 38 species to the Glarborg mechanism involving 150 species. The coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and transported-PDF method are used for the turbulence modeling, and the reaction–diffusion manifolds (REDIMs) are used as an advanced technique for the simplification of chemical kinetics and to speed up the numerical computation. It is demonstrated that these chemical mechanisms have an ability to represent the degree of local extinction and re-ignition accurately. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis shows that the degree of local extinction is very sensitive to only several key elementary reactions, and an analysis on the turbulence–chemistry interaction investigates the influence of these elementary reactions.
